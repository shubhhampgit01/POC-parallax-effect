# POC of PARALLAX EFFECT

This repository contains a proof of concept (POC) implementation of a parallax effect, showcasing a visually appealing design with smooth animation effects. The parallax effect is a technique where background elements move at a different speed than foreground elements, creating an illusion of depth and immersion as the user scrolls or interacts with the interface.

## Features

* Parallax Scrolling: Background elements scroll at a different speed compared to foreground elements, providing a sense of depth and dimension.
* Smooth Animation Effects: The transition and animation effects are carefully crafted to ensure a seamless and visually pleasing experience.
* Customizable: Easily customizable to fit various design themes and requirements.
* Responsive Design: The parallax effect is optimized for various screen sizes and devices, ensuring a consistent user experience across platforms.
